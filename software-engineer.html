  <h4>You</h4>
  <p class="normal-p">You have a passion for high-quality, reliable and maintainable code. You’re comfortable working side by side with product managers, designers, and clients, making decisions together to deliver valuable working software to clients and their users. You are agile and retrospective, and not afraid to identify what we’re doing wrong so we can fix it, and what we're doing right so we can improve on it. Above all, you judge your success by the success of your team and the happiness of our customers.</p>
  <p class="normal-p">Furthering your education has always been a goal of yours. Learning new programming languages and getting to work with Golang and Elixir piques your interest.</p>
  <p class="normal-p">Contributing to open source software makes you feel right about the transparency it brings to an organization's code quality.</p>
  <br />
  <h4>Your Day</h4>
  <p class="normal-p">We pair program, all day, every day because we know it delivers remarkable results. We practice and teach an approach to software engineering that applies across industries and organizations, so you’ll experience all types of teams, products, and technologies. And we believe in working at a sustainable pace – you’ll typically code hard for 8 hours each day, but then you’re off work to relax, recharge and refocus.</p>
