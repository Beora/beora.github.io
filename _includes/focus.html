        <h2>Why is productivity so important to us?</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">We’re in the business of building products in such a way that tightens the feedback loop, so that we’re validating assumptions and course correcting early and as often as necessary. We love software, but what we love more is building the <strong>right product</strong>, and that almost never happens on the first attempt. That’s why productivity and quick iteration are so important. Practically every decision we make is made with this in mind.</p>
        <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-4">We spend time directly with your users, and prototype on paper and whiteboards, to quickly test our hypotheses. Our aim is for every decision we make to be validated. Usability testing is done weekly, to rapidly evaluate and assess features and functions, ensuring that your product is always on the right track.</p>
